# BigMarket - Bitcoin Prediction Market powered by Stacks

## Introduction

The current prediction market landscape is fragmented, with platforms that are either too complex for mainstream adoption or restricted to specific regions like North America. Most fail to integrate AI for enhanced market efficiency and accessibility.

BigMarketAI is a Bitcoin-native, AI-powered, and decentralized prediction market designed for global accessibility. Our vision is to create a user-owned, simple, and engaging platform that leverages AI to improve forecasting, enhance liquidity, and eliminate manipulation.

We prioritize openness, community governance, and value-sharing, ensuring that every participant benefits from the system’s growth. With a focus on simplicity (Yes/No markets), uncensored freedom, and seamless Bitcoin integration, BigMarketAI is redefining prediction markets for a more automated and transparent future.

# Problem and Solution

**Problem**:

The current prediction market landscape is hindered by several key issues:

- Centralized Control Existing platforms are owned and operated by centralized entities, limiting user autonomy and trust.
- Censorship Markets are often restricted or shut down due to regulatory or platform-specific policies.
- Slow Market Frequency Traditional prediction markets suffer from delays in market creation and settlement, reducing engagement and efficiency.
- Regional Limitations Most platforms primarily cater to the U.S. market, leaving global users underserved.

#### Solution:

BigMarketAI is a Bitcoin-native, AI-enhanced, and decentralized prediction market designed to overcome these limitations:

- Decentralized DAO A fully user-owned governance model ensures autonomy, transparency, and censorship resistance.
- Open & Unrestricted No gatekeeping, allowing anyone to create and participate in markets freely.
- High-Frequency Markets AI-powered automation (AIBTC) enables fast market creation, settlement, and liquidity optimization.
- Global Accessibility Built on Bitcoin’s secure and trustless infrastructure, ensuring open participation from anywhere in the world.

BigMarketAI provides a frictionless, decentralized, and AI-driven alternative that lowers barriers for crypto users while maximizing efficiency and accessibility in prediction markets.

# Product Overview & USP

Our solution leverages an AI-powered mechanism that automates market creation and ensures high market frequency across hundreds of predictions. Unlike traditional prediction markets, BigMarket operates as a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), ensuring that users and AI agents control the platform without censorship or third-party interference.

We are removing regional limitations, high entry barriers, and slow market execution. BigMarket redefines prediction markets with a focus on open source, interoperability, simplicity, fairness, and accessibility.

#### Unique Selling Proposition (USP)

BigMarket is developing the future of decentralized forecasting, leveraging Bitcoin’s security and AI’s intelligence to create a fast, open, and truly global platform.

## Technical InnovationBigMarket – Bridging Bitcoin to Clarity Smart Contracts with sBTC

BigMarket developed a secondary layer solution that enables the seamless movement of Bitcoin from the Bitcoin blockchain into a programmable smart contract environment on Stacks. This is achieved by leveraging the latest upgrades in the Stacks ecosystem most notably the Nakamoto upgrade and sBTC. Together, these innovations allow BigMarket to bring Bitcoin directly into Clarity smart contracts, powering decentralized prediction markets with Bitcoin in a trust-minimized way.

## BTC & Bitcoin Interoperability

Trust-Minimized Bitcoin Bridge: The Stacks *Nakamoto* upgrade paves the way for sBTC, a new asset that serves as a 1:1 Bitcoin-backed token on Stacks. sBTC operates as an open-network, decentralized two-way peg that brings Bitcoin into the Stacks chain with minimal counterparty ris In BigMarket design, users lock up native BTC and receive sBTC of equivalent value on Stacks, which can then be used inside Clarity contracts.

This trust-minimized bridge means Bitcoin holders can participate in smart contract applications (like prediction markets) without relying on centralized custodians or wrapped tokens, preserving Bitcoin’s security guarantees while unlocking its programmability​. Essentially, sBTC allows Bitcoin to be utilized in decentralized apps on Stacks without compromising on security or trust, giving Bitcoin the same level of smart contract functionality typically found on other chains but anchored to Bitcoin’s robustness.

**Gasless Transactions for Bitcoin Holders**

No STX Required for Users: BigMarket Aims to abstract away the need for STX (Stacks native token) when Bitcoin users interact with its markets. Thanks to enhancements in the Stacks ecosystem and BigMarket architecture, participants only need Bitcoin to stake or bet, and do not have to manage STX for transaction fees. This is possible through mechanisms like sponsored transactions or using STX/sBTC to cover gas fees. For example, members of the Stacks community have proposed letting wallets or services pay the STX gas fee on behalf of the user and deduct an equivalent amount of sBTC from the users balance​

**Approaches like this ensure that a Bitcoin holder can transact on the Stacks layer without ever purchasing STX, a feature strongly demanded by users and even exchanges​**.

In practice, BigMarket handles the Clarity contract fees behind the scenes (possibly by converting a tiny portion of the user’s Bitcoin stake via sBTC to pay the miner in STX), resulting in a “gasless” feel for the user.

**This frictionless UX means Bitcoin users interact purely with Bitcoin** they can initiate prediction market bets or payouts with a simple Bitcoin transaction, while BigMarket’s infrastructure deals with all underlying Stacks complexities.

## Clarity

Transparent On-Chain Logic: BigMarket’s prediction markets are powered by Clarity smart contracts on Stacks, which handle market creation, resolution of outcomes, and payouts to winners in an automated way.

All BigMarket contract logic is executed directly on-chain, and because Clarity is an interpreted (not compiled) language, the code’s behavior is fully transparent and verifiable by anyone. This ensures full transparency and trustlessness: every bet, outcome, and payout follows rules that are public and cannot be altered or hidden. By leveraging Clarity’s strengths, BigMarket provides an automated marketplace that is provably fair and tamper-proof, giving participants confidence that outcomes are determined exactly as the code intends. **Direct Bitcoin Wallet Settlements**

Native BTC Payouts via sBTC: A key feature of BigMarket’s integration is that winnings are paid out in actual Bitcoin. When a prediction market is resolved, users can claim their rewards through the sBTC peg, which will release the equivalent BTC back to their normal Bitcoin address. The design of sBTC as a two-way peg makes this process seamless  it s as easy to move BTC *out* of the Stacks layer as it is to move it in. The sBTC system is specifically built so that users can easily move BTC in and out of the layer in a secure, decentralized manner​
